an older computer with a small monitor, or a slow connection. I dont really 
care about what you have to sav, in fact  I am probably illiterate, but I 
do like to look at pretty pictures. I realize  that if I click here, the zines
will load faster at the expense of detail.  I'll either go get the magnifying 
glass or forfeit my eyesight. </font></A></td>

I'm a fairly normal person  with a fairly normal  setup. I have no interest
in seeing tiny, tiny details, but enjoy reading zines for the thought content
      <b>in addition to</b> the novelty. I am not an absolute religious devotee
of this zine, but I am greatful for the website and would like to start browsing
it, thank you very much. </font></A></td>
      <td valign="top" width="33%"><font face="Comic Sans MS"
 color="#ffffff"> I am a "Stuff and Nonsense" fanatic!  I must have a CD
with super high-resolution scans of the zine, including free image browsing
software. I absolutely must see every little detail involved  in every issue,
down to the dust mites eating away at the ink. I'm even crazy  enough to
pay for this CD. I realize that $5 is not a great price to pay for a quality
'zine archive like this one (thats 1/2 price!), and I know it goes toward
a good cause. I'm sending money now to allow Beth to buy more octopii (for
rhetorical purposes). Is it ok if I buy a few CDs for my extended family?
